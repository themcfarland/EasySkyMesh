# Add sensors to repeaters
This is the instruction to add sensors to repeaters:
- The list is based on the official MeshCore firmware and the [PowerSaving MeshCore firmware](https://github.com/IoTThinks/EasySkyMesh?tab=readme-ov-file#1-powersaving-meshcore-firmware).
- The list will be updated for new sensors.

PowerSaving firmware has powersaving feature and additional features.
- **9mA** power consumption for most ESP32S3 boards (Except Xiao S3)
- **8.5mA** power consumption for all NRF52 boards.

## 2. Boards
This section is for boards with some notes.

### Heltec v3
On Heltec v3, the GPIO17 and 18 are tiny pads in the middle of the board bottom.
- It is small. So solder with care.

## 3. I2C Sensors
This is the list of sensors currently supported by official MeshCore firmware.
- You may need to do some solder to make sure the sensors use the pre-defined I2C addresses.

### 3.1 GPS
This is for GPS sensor.
- For RAK boards: PIN_GPS_TX => 15 and PIN_GPS_RX => 16
- [To be updated] For other boards: PIN_GPS_TX => XX and PIN_GPS_RX => YY. This depends on boards.

### 3.2 AHTX0
This is AHT10 and AHT20 Humidity and Temperature Sensor.
- I2C address: 0x38

### 3.3 BME680
The BME680 is a compact environmental sensor by Bosch that measures temperature, humidity, barometric pressure, and air quality (gas/VOC).
* Note: As of 20 Dec 2025, MeshCore app can not show the Gas telemetry properly in Channel 1 or 2.
* I2C address: **0x76**
* For Adafruit BME280, you need to solder the Addr pad to use I2C address 0x76.
* For other BME280 boards, you are strongly recommended to wire **GND to SDO** to force to use address 0x76. Else, the I2C address may jump either 0x76 and 0x77.

### 3.4 BME280
The BME280 is a compact environmental sensor by Bosch that measures temperature, humidity, and barometric pressure.
* I2C address: **0x76**
* For Adafruit BME280, you need to solder the Addr pad to use I2C address 0x76
* For other BME280 boards, you are strongly recommended to wire **GND to SDO** to force to use address 0x76. Else, the I2C address may jump either 0x76 and 0x77.
